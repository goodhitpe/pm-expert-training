## Key Challenges and Issues

### Challenge 1: Compressed Timeline for Pre-Launch
**Description:** Product development delays pushed the product launch from April to June, compressing the campaign development timeline from 4 months to 2 months while maintaining the same launch date.

**Impact:** High - Quality of creative assets and media planning  
**Current Status:** Timeline compressed, team working extended hours  
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Prioritize critical deliverables (TV, digital, website)
- Reduce scope of non-essential content (blog articles from 50 to 30)
- Increase agency resources with higher budget allocation
- Parallel track creative development and media planning
- Daily standup meetings to identify blockers

### Challenge 2: Budget Constraints vs. Ambitions
**Description:** Initial budget request of $3.5M was reduced to $3.2M due to corporate cost-cutting, requiring $300K in optimizations while maintaining campaign effectiveness.

**Impact:** High - Campaign reach and frequency  
**Current Status:** Budget optimization in progress  
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Reduce TV buy by 30% and shift budget to digital ($150K savings)
- Negotiate better agency rates and reduce scope ($50K savings)
- Reduce print advertising by 50% ($75K savings)
- Optimize influencer mix (fewer macro, more micro) ($25K savings)
- Performance-based optimization to maximize efficiency

### Challenge 3: Competitive Market Entry
**Description:** Entering a market dominated by Amazon, Google, and Apple with stronger brand recognition and established ecosystems. Recent competitor product launches have raised the bar.

**Impact:** Critical - Market share achievement and differentiation  
**Current Status:** Differentiation strategy in development  
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Focus on unique product features (privacy, customization)
- Aggressive pricing strategy for launch period
- Partner with complementary brands
- Emphasize value proposition in all messaging
- Target specific underserved customer segments

### Challenge 4: Multi-Regional Coordination
**Description:** Coordinating campaign execution across three major regions (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific) with different languages, cultures, time zones, and regulatory requirements.

**Impact:** High - Campaign consistency and efficiency  
**Current Status:** Regional teams identified, coordination framework in place  
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Global campaign toolkit with localization guidelines
- Regional adaptation budget and timeline
- Weekly global coordination meetings
- Local market experts for each region
- Centralized approval process with regional input

### Challenge 5: Influencer Partnership Reliability
**Description:** Influencer marketing is critical to reach younger demographics, but influencer reliability, content quality, and FTC compliance are ongoing concerns.

**Impact:** Medium - Brand safety and campaign authenticity  
**Current Status:** Influencer vetting in progress  
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Rigorous influencer vetting process
- Clear contracts with deliverables and timelines
- Content approval process before posting
- Compliance training and disclosure requirements
- Backup influencers identified for each tier

### Challenge 6: Attribution and ROI Measurement
**Description:** Multi-channel campaign with complex customer journey makes it difficult to accurately attribute conversions and calculate true ROI for each channel.

**Impact:** Medium - Budget optimization and future planning  
**Current Status:** Attribution model in development  
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Implement multi-touch attribution model
- Unique tracking codes for each channel
- Customer surveys to understand decision journey
- Marketing mix modeling for holistic view
- Test and learn approach with holdout markets

### Challenge 7: Retail Partner Alignment
**Description:** Securing premium placement and co-marketing support from major retail partners (Best Buy, Target, etc.) who have existing relationships with competitors.

**Impact:** High - Retail distribution and in-store presence  
**Current Status:** Negotiations ongoing with mixed results  
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Co-marketing budget allocation for partners
- Exclusive launch bundles for key retailers
- Sales training and demo equipment provided
- Performance guarantees and incentives
- Direct-to-consumer channel as alternative

## Questions and Exercises for Students

### Exercise 1: Budget Optimization Challenge
**Scenario:** You need to reduce the budget from $3.5M to $3.2M (save $300K) while maintaining campaign effectiveness. The CMO will not accept reducing the revenue target.

**Tasks:**
1. Analyze each budget category and identify reduction opportunities
2. Create 3 different budget optimization scenarios with trade-offs
3. Recommend which channels to cut and which to protect (with justification)
4. Project the impact on reach, frequency, and expected revenue
5. Present your recommendation in an executive summary format

### Exercise 2: Crisis Management
**Scenario:** On launch day (June 1), a major tech publication publishes a negative review highlighting privacy concerns with the smart hub. The article is trending on social media and competitors are amplifying the narrative.

**Tasks:**
1. Assess the severity and potential impact of this crisis
2. Develop an immediate response plan (first 24 hours)
3. Create a longer-term reputation management strategy
4. Draft key messages and communication materials
5. Identify stakeholders who need to be informed/involved
6. Recommend any changes to the ongoing campaign

### Exercise 3: Media Mix Optimization
**Scenario:** After 30 days of the launch campaign, you have performance data showing TV has low attribution (3% of conversions) while paid social has high ROAS (7:1). You have $800K remaining in your media budget.

**Performance Data:**
- TV: $500K spent, 5M impressions, 3% of conversions, impossible to accurately track
- Paid Search: $200K spent, 2M impressions, 25% of conversions, 5:1 ROAS
- Paid Social: $150K spent, 8M impressions, 40% of conversions, 7:1 ROAS
- Display: $100K spent, 10M impressions, 8% of conversions, 3:1 ROAS
- Print: $50K spent, 1M impressions, 2% of conversions, 2:1 ROAS

**Tasks:**
1. Analyze the performance data and identify insights
2. Recommend how to reallocate the remaining $800K budget
3. Consider both short-term performance and long-term brand building
4. Justify your recommendations with data and strategic rationale
5. Anticipate objections from stakeholders (e.g., CMO who loves TV)

### Exercise 4: Influencer Program Management
**Scenario:** You've contracted with 50 influencers (10 macro, 40 micro). Three weeks before launch, 2 macro influencers (combined 2M followers) drop out, and 5 micro influencers are producing low-quality content that doesn't meet brand standards.

**Tasks:**
1. Assess the impact of losing the macro influencers
2. Create a plan to replace the lost reach and engagement
3. Develop a quality improvement plan for underperforming micro influencers
4. Design a content approval process to prevent future issues
5. Calculate ROI for the influencer program and determine if it's worth continuing
6. Make recommendations for future influencer programs

### Exercise 5: Multi-Regional Coordination
**Scenario:** You need to adapt the North American campaign for Europe and Asia-Pacific. Each region has different:
- Cultural norms and values
- Privacy regulations (GDPR in Europe)
- Competitive landscapes
- Media consumption habits
- Language requirements

**Tasks:**
1. Identify what elements of the campaign can remain consistent globally
2. Determine what needs to be localized for each region
3. Create a localization plan with timeline and budget
4. Develop a governance model for regional adaptation vs. global consistency
5. Design a communication framework for coordinating across regions

### Exercise 6: Attribution Modeling
**Scenario:** A customer's journey to purchase involves multiple touchpoints:
- Sees TV ad (Week 1)
- Clicks on paid search ad (Week 2)
- Receives email (Week 3)
- Sees retargeting display ad (Week 3)
- Clicks on organic social post (Week 4)
- Makes purchase (Week 4)

**Tasks:**
1. Compare how different attribution models would credit this conversion:
   - Last-click attribution
   - First-click attribution
   - Linear attribution
   - Time-decay attribution
   - Position-based attribution
2. Recommend which attribution model is most appropriate for this campaign
3. Explain how your choice impacts budget allocation decisions
4. Identify limitations of your chosen model
5. Design a measurement framework that accounts for multi-channel journeys

### Exercise 7: Competitive Response
**Scenario:** On July 1, Amazon announces a major price drop on Echo devices (30% off) and launches a "Prime Day" smart home bundle promotion. This is directly competitive with your campaign during a critical sales period.

**Tasks:**
1. Conduct a rapid competitive analysis of Amazon's offer
2. Assess the threat to your campaign objectives (revenue, market share)
3. Develop 3 response options (price match, differentiate, ignore)
4. Analyze the financial and strategic implications of each option
5. Make a recommendation with supporting analysis
6. Create an action plan for your recommended response
7. Draft communication to stakeholders about the situation

### Exercise 8: Campaign Dashboard Design
**Tasks:**
1. Design a real-time campaign dashboard for the CMO showing:
   - Overall campaign health
   - Progress toward key objectives
   - Channel performance comparison

### Exercise 9: Pre-Order Shortfall Recovery
**Scenario:** On May 25 (6 days before pre-order period ends), you have 52,000 pre-orders vs. the 75,000 target. The trend suggests you'll end at ~60,000 unless you take action.

**Tasks:**
1. Diagnose why pre-orders are underperforming (review hypothetical data)
2. Develop an emergency action plan to close the gap
3. Identify quick-win tactics that can be executed in 6 days
4. Calculate the additional budget needed (if any) and source it
5. Assess whether it's better to extend the pre-order period vs. push harder
6. Create a communication plan for stakeholders
7. Update risk register and lessons learned

### Exercise 10: Post-Campaign Analysis and Recommendations
**Scenario:** The campaign has ended. Final results:
- Revenue: $280M (vs. $250M target) ✓
- New customers: 550,000 (vs. 500,000 target) ✓
- Market share: 4.2% (vs. 5% target) ✗
- Brand awareness: 32% (vs. 35% target) ✗
- ROAS: 3.5:1 (vs. 4:1 target) ✗
- Total spend: $3.35M (vs. $3.2M budget) ✗

**Tasks:**
1. Conduct a comprehensive post-campaign analysis
2. Identify what worked well and what didn't
3. Calculate actual ROI and compare to projections
4. Determine root causes for missed targets (market share, brand awareness, ROAS)
5. Extract lessons learned for future campaigns
6. Recommend adjustments for the ongoing marketing program
7. Create an executive presentation summarizing results and learnings

### Exercise 11: Stakeholder Communication Simulation
**Scenario:** On July 15 (mid-campaign), you're presenting to the executive team. The CMO is happy with sales performance but the CFO is concerned about budget overruns, and the CTO is frustrated about website performance issues.

**Tasks:**
1. Prepare a comprehensive mid-campaign presentation covering:
   - Executive summary of performance vs. objectives
   - Budget status and forecast
   - Key wins and challenges
   - Course corrections made
   - Recommendations for remainder of campaign
2. Develop talking points for addressing each stakeholder's concerns
3. Prepare backup slides for anticipated questions
4. Practice delivering difficult messages (budget overrun) effectively
5. Design a decision framework for a key decision point

### Exercise 12: Contingency Planning Exercise
**Scenario:** Create contingency plans for these scenarios:
1. Product shortage limits availability to 60% of demand
2. Major product defect discovered requiring recall
3. Key retail partner (Best Buy) backs out of placement deal
4. Social media backlash due to perceived privacy violations
5. Advertising agency loses key personnel mid-campaign
